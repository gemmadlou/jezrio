# Jerzio

Just an idea at the moment. But yes, another backend javascript framework. If you want to push me to get this going, just give me a shout.

## What will make this one different

- Contract-based and declarative APIs using Swagger UI and Json Schema
- Validation done in middleware layers by using Json Schema contracts
- Services decoupled from Framework so framework services are more straightforward to mock and test
- Database scheme is declarative
- Production containers out of the box
- JSDocs + Typescript to have zero-compilation and pure javascript, but static analysis out-of-the-box
- Prettier so code rules don't need code reviews
- MySQL and Mongo integrations out of the box
- Dockerized app for easier development
- Stateless so it can be ran on AWS Lambda, on bare metal or inside a container
